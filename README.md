### Service Overview
Cloud environment has become more common. I believe that most of SE has experienced cloud services, although Cloud services have to be used additionally using current Legacy equipment most of the times. Even it makes SE take more time to learn how to use complicated user portal by using multiple cloud services.


You pay for AWS with a great number of functions which is barely used in combination with co-location legacy equipment. Is AWS really beneficial? Well, is cloud really essential?


No matter which server you use, you open excel to manage asset by yourself after all. All information about asset is input manually, and making changes in system without updating to excel happens quite a lot.


No matter which cloud service or hosting you use, aren't you just log on at the first time and hardly ever log on again afterward? In the end, only familiar functions in the system are used rather than complicated new service. You will find yourself opening excel and inputting data to it as usual.


It is not easy to persuade a superior to purchase a tool for asset management. Managers purchase solutions to figure numbers or efficiency for ROI or whatever they care, but mean for tools that hands-on workers need. So it is hard to use for hands-on workers are not able to use money from their pocket, and management tools for hands-on workers mostly cost money. Who is the solution for? Who is the tool for?


Now, there is a practical propose for SE.


You may register by yourself for new brilliant services coming out every day and giving you a hard time, since there are necessary functions. (We don't offer huge services... orz...) But we offer the most convenient service that will lessen your concerns intuitively.


giip offers the functions you truly need for free, and also charged service which you can process an expense report to pay.


There is no exceptional automatic function in giip. There is no remarkably advanced technology.


What we do is to think deeply at all times how we can mitigate your inconvenience since we do same work having same concerns as you.

From a minor question, we listen to your opinion about feature that you desire, and will provide the most convenient result for you. Even you can tell us your concern not regarding our services. Who knows? Peter Pan might suddenly appear.. ^^;;


If you have been putting all screens together all the while by using unrealistic services which go on and on what functions or what services are, how about integrating all the systems to this just one service?

### OE : On-Premise Edition
On-Premise Edition is a service for information security with servers under the control of customers. It is provided as an appliance which is located at a place that the customer designates, and data storage is applied by customers' enterprise security rule.


Some of administration ports need to be connected to our administration system for server operation and version management. In the case of blocking network completely for customer's security issue, server status will be monitored by the customer. However, server access privileges and support in the case of server failure will be handled by our Tier 1 Support company.

Some people wonder how we can get profit when we offer free services. To conclude, a profit will be made by you.
